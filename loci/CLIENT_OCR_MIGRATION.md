# Client-Side OCR Migration

## Overview

This document describes the migration from server-side OCR to client-side OCR to resolve serverless limitations and improve user experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Client-Side OCR Component (`app/components/ClientSideOCR.tsx`)

- Created a React hook `useClientSideOCR` that handles OCR processing in the browser
- Uses Tesseract.js for text extraction and recognition
- Implements address and name matching algorithms
- Provides progress tracking for better UX
- Handles both image and PDF files

### 2. New API Route (`app/api/verify-address/client-route.ts`)

- Accepts client-side OCR results instead of performing server-side OCR
- Still performs server-side operations:
  - Document validity checks
  - Zoning/cadastral verification
  - IP and location analysis
- Calculates overall verification scores using client OCR results

### 3. Updated Form (`app/demo/form.tsx`)

- Integrated client-side OCR processing
- Shows real-time progress during OCR
- Sends OCR results to the new API endpoint
- Improved loading states and user feedback

### 4. Updated Next.js Configuration (`next.config.js`)

- Removed server-side WASM handling
- Configured WASM for client-side only
- Removed server-side Tesseract.js dependencies
- Maintained CORS headers for WASM files

### 5. Test Page (`app/test-ocr/page.tsx`)

- Simple test interface to verify client-side OCR functionality
- Upload documents and test address/name matching
- View detailed OCR results and extracted text

## Benefits

### 1. Resolves Serverless Limitations
- No more WASM file access issues in serverless environments
- Eliminates server-side memory constraints
- Reduces cold start times

### 2. Better User Experience
- Real-time progress feedback during OCR processing
- Faster initial response times
- No server timeout issues for large documents

### 3. Improved Scalability
- OCR processing distributed across client devices
- Reduced server load and costs
- Better handling of concurrent users

### 4. Enhanced Privacy
- Document processing happens locally in the browser
- Reduced data transmission to server
- Better compliance with privacy regulations

## Usage

### For Developers

1. **Using the Client-Side OCR Hook:**
```typescript
import useClientSideOCR from '@/app/components/ClientSideOCR';

const { processImage, isProcessing, isInitialized } = useClientSideOCR();

const handleOCR = async (file: File, address: string, name: string) => {
  const result = await processImage(file, address, name, (progress) => {
    console.log(`OCR Progress: ${progress * 100}%`);
  });
  
  console.log('OCR Result:', result);
};
```

2. **API Integration:**
```typescript
const response = await fetch('/api/verify-address/client', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    full_name: 'John Doe',
    typed_address: '123 Main St',
    utility_bill: base64Data,
    id_document: base64Data,
    client_ocr_results: {
      utility_bill: utilityOCRResult,
      id_document: idOCRResult
    }
  })
});
```

### For Users

1. **Testing OCR:**
   - Navigate to `/test-ocr` to test the client-side OCR functionality
   - Upload a document and provide expected address/name
   - View detailed results and extracted text

2. **Using the Main Form:**
   - The main verification form now processes OCR client-side
   - Progress is shown during document processing
   - Results are sent to server for additional verification

## Technical Details

### OCR Result Structure
```typescript
interface OCRResult {
  extractedText: string;
  addressMatched: boolean;
  nameMatched: boolean;
  matchScore: number;
  confidence: number;
  foundAddresses: string[];
  fullName: string;
  fuzzyAddressMatched: boolean;
  strictAddressMatched: boolean;
  normalizedProvidedAddress: string;
  normalizedExtractedText: string;
  blockMatches?: number;
  totalBlocks?: number;
}
```

### Supported File Types
- Images: JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF
- Documents: PDF (converted to images for OCR)

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with WebAssembly support
- Chrome 57+, Firefox 52+, Safari 11+, Edge 79+

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
- API endpoint changed from `/api/verify-address` to `/api/verify-address/client`
- New required field `client_ocr_results` in API payload
- Server-side OCR functions no longer used

### Environment Variables
- No changes required for environment variables
- All existing API keys and configurations remain the same

### Dependencies
- Tesseract.js is now used client-side only
- Server-side dependencies reduced
- No changes to package.json required

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **OCR Not Initializing:**
   - Check browser console for WASM loading errors
   - Ensure browser supports WebAssembly
   - Verify network connectivity for WASM file downloads

2. **Slow OCR Performance:**
   - Large images may take longer to process
   - Consider image compression before upload
   - Check browser memory usage

3. **OCR Accuracy Issues:**
   - Ensure clear, high-resolution images
   - Check that documents are properly oriented
   - Verify text is not obscured or blurry

### Debug Mode
- Use the test page at `/test-ocr` for debugging
- Check browser console for detailed error messages
- Monitor network tab for WASM file loading

## Future Enhancements

1. **Performance Optimizations:**
   - Image preprocessing for better OCR accuracy
   - Caching of OCR models
   - Parallel processing for multiple documents

2. **Feature Additions:**
   - Support for more document types
   - Advanced text extraction algorithms
   - Machine learning-based address matching

3. **User Experience:**
   - Drag-and-drop file upload
   - Real-time document preview
   - Batch processing capabilities
